*Note: This chapter appears to be incomplete in the source HTML file. Only the title and introduction were available. Additional content for specialized and modern methods would typically include:*

- Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression)
- Non-parametric methods (Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, etc.)
- Bootstrap and resampling methods
- Mixed-effects models for repeated measures
- Time series analysis
- Machine learning approaches in biostatistics
- Bayesian methods
- Meta-analysis techniques
- Handling missing data (imputation methods)
- High-dimensional data analysis

*These topics would be covered in a complete version of this chapter.*

## Chapter Overview
Building on the foundational concepts from @sec-foundational-concepts, this chapter explores methods for comparing groups and testing hypotheses. These techniques prepare you for the advanced modeling approaches covered in @sec-modeling-relationships.

## Welch's t-Test & Paired t-Test

When the equal variance assumption is violated or when data comes in natural pairs, we need specialized approaches to maintain valid statistical inference.

### Welch's t-Test (Unequal Variances)

When group variances differ substantially, the pooled t-test can give misleading results. Welch's t-test adjusts for unequal variances.

$$t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}$$

$$df = \frac{\left(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\right)^2}{\frac{\left(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}\right)^2}{n_1-1} + \frac{\left(\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\right)^2}{n_2-1}}$$

Comparing recovery times between two surgical procedures:

- **Procedure A:** mean=7 days, sd=2 days (low variability)
- **Procedure B:** mean=8 days, sd=5 days (high variability)

The large difference in standard deviations suggests using Welch's t-test.

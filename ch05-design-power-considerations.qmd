# Chapter 5: Design & Power Considerations

Plan studies effectively by determining appropriate sample sizes and control error rates when testing multiple hypotheses.

*Note: This chapter appears to be incomplete in the source HTML file. Only the title and introduction were available. Additional content for design and power considerations would typically include:*

- Study design principles
- Sample size calculation methods
- Power analysis techniques
- Multiple testing corrections (Bonferroni, FDR, etc.)
- Type I and Type II error control
- Interim analysis and stopping rules
- Adaptive trial designs

*These topics would be covered in a complete version of this chapter.*
